# DraculaDayByDay
An Android app to experience Bram Stokers work in same tempo as the characters in the novel.

Dracula by Bram Stoker is, amongst other things, an epistolary novel - that is to say, a novel where the story is told through diary entries, newspaper articles, letters, and so forth. In the case of Dracula, all the entries are dated.

This app strives to let the user experience the story either in the same tempo as the characters (according to the date of the entries) or on the actual calendar day (though obviously only in accordance to the month and the day) that it occurred in the novel.
