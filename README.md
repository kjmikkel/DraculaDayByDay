# DraculaDayByDay
An Android app to experience Bram Stokers work in "real time".

Dracula by Bram Stolker is, amongst other things, an epistolary novel - that is to say a novel where the story is told through diary entries, newspaper articles, letters, and so forth. In the case of Dracula all the entries are dated.

This app strives to let the user experience the story either in the same tempo as the characters (acording to the date of the entries) or on the actual calender day (though obviously only in accordence to the month and the day) that it occoured in the novel.
